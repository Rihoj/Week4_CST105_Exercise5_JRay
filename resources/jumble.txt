This is text that needs to be jumbled based
on row and column. I am very curious as to t
he result of this document. Are you? I sure
hope so! I am going to fill this space with
some more characters to really see the exten
t of this document. I hope I get a good grad
e on this. I do need to remember to start co
mmenting on my code. I just don't think that
 many comments are useful for good code read
ability. However, it is part of the assignme
nt. I also need to start participating in cl
ass more. I just don't have much useful feed
back for anyone. Even after being in the pro
gramming world for more than 10 years I stil
l have a hard time giving people feedback ot
her than "Good Job." However, that is not se
en as helpful feedback.
